Streszczenie

Background/aim: In this study, our aim was to investigate the neutrophil/lymphocyte (N/L) ratio, variations in leukocytes and leukocyte subtypes, and the relationship between N/L ratio and insulin resistance (IR) in obesity.

Materials and methods: Ninety-six patients and 40 healthy controls were included in this study. Patients’ blood glucose levels, insulin levels, and hemogram parameters upon 8 h of fasting were determined. Body mass index (BMI) and Homeostasis Model Assessment-Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) values were calculated.

Results: Neutrophil numbers were found to be higher among obese patients with IR than among non-IR obese patients. The N/L ratio was, moreover, found to be higher among obese patients with IR when compared to non-IR obese patients. A positive correlation was found between insulin resistance and both neutrophil and WBC counts. Positive correlations were also found between insulin levels and the N/L ratio, WBC counts, and neutrophil counts

Conclusion: In our study, leukocyte numbers and subtypes were determined to be higher among obese individuals than among healthy individuals. The N/L ratio was increased significantly only among obese patients with IR. Further studies are needed in order to better demonstrate the relationship between the N/L ratio and IR/inflammation.
