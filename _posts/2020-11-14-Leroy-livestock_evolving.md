Podsumowanie:

Conclusion: The present study illustrates the clash between a historically contingent biosocial desire for animal foods and contemporary narratives that portray livestock as damaging to humans, animals, and the planet. It is unclear in which direction the current view on livestock production that is now prevalent in the urban settings of the West (in particular within the Anglosphere), will evolve to absorb this tension between foodscapes and thoughtscapes, and how exactly it will generate purpose in a society fragmented by status anxiety and in desperate need of common challenges. According to one radical scenario, livestock would be rendered obsolete as humans adopt a (top-down) vegan societal model. Another option would involve a profound rethinking of the way animal husbandry is performed in future domains, embracing it as part of the solution rather than being at the core of the problem. Evidently, these are two opposite setups whereas the future would more likely lead to a mosaic of business-as-usual practices, ‘plant-based’ options, and animal farming with strong agroecological principles. In its conclusive version, the vegan scenario would have vast implications on societal organization. Rather than ending up as a wholesome approach, it risks being highjacked by vested interests and totalitarian schemes. It would be particularly difficult to reverse such a situation, once established. By opposing the elimination of animal husbandry and deruminization of grasslands, rangelands, and pasturelands, and the reactive pleas for less or none, we argue that an affirmative response is to be preferred (a thoughtscape of more and better). The most promising way forward, in our opinion, would consist of a combination of the best of current animal husbandry and grazing systems design, revitalized by increased bio-circular praxis, and a much richer approach to human–animal–land interactions than is currently the case. ‘Problems’ of environment, soil, diet, health, and livestock need to be faced positively with the intention to expand, connect, and innovate. Such approach would need to be open, creative, and in search of actualization, whereby humans and animals would work with rather than against nature.
